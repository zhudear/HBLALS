# Train
To search loss, you can run ```python train_search_loss.py```

To search architecture, you can run ```python train_search_architecture.py```

To train the model, you can run ```python train.py```
# Pretrained models
To evaluate our trained models, run ```python test.py```

The pretrained models are coming soon!
